multimedia systems third project spring 2024 Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)

This project is a GUI-based application that allows users to classify images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application accepts images captured from a webcam or chosen from existing local images, and it displays the classified label on the output image.

Features:

User Interface (GUI): Provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the classification model.

Image Capture and Selection: Users can capture a new image using the webcam or select an existing image from local files.

Real-time Classification Display: The classified category is displayed on the output image within the GUI.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., ResNet or MobileNet) via PyTorch or TensorFlow for high-accuracy classification.

Prerequisites:

Python 3

Libraries: OpenCV, PyTorch or TensorFlow, PYQT , NumPy, and PIL 

Hardware: Webcam access for real-time capture functionality
